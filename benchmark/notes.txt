- today, my goal is to get an idea of where you are
    - we'll start with a pretty simple skills assessment i created 
    - if that's easy for you, there are some good websites with more challenging problems that we can work on
    - i also want to brainstorm project ideas with you, because i think the best way to learn is to apply your skills. if you like the 
    concept/math problems, we can definitely work on those as well and you can do them on your own time and check back with me at each sessions.

- ask what his goals and interests are

- propose project ideas
    -> continue working on game?
    -> start new game?
    -> build tic tac toe game with AI opponent?
    -> explore AI?
    -> pyscript website?


- ask if he's interested in learning any other languages
    -> C++ or Rust would be for more of the math/concept-heavy problems
    -> JS would be for creating websites
    -> Swift would be for creating mobile apps


- if he's doing well, transition to project euler or hacker rank
